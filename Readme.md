# Kaooa: Strategy hunt game from India

Kaooa, otherwise known as "Vulture and Crows" is a traditional game from India. Like [Len Choa](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/len-choa-leopards-and-tiger-game/) (*"Tiger and Leopards"*) and [Fox and Geese](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/fox-and-geese/), it is a hunt game. Hunt games often pit one player with one token against a second player who has multiple tokens. As you can tell, the tokens usually are named after animals, a fun dynamic that adds a little imaginative spirit to the game.
